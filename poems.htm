            <h1><b> The Wilderness</b></h1>
            <P>Standing by the balcony
                </br>
                I hear the reunion of the Wilderness
                </br>
                Bush beasts filled with joy</br>they sing out loud</br>Hossana we thank God
                </br>
                Crickets too crick out
                </br>Yet as all goes on I grow thin
                </br>
                Inciting to ma wound</br>Is the cold breeze that</br>Blows harder and deeper</br>In to ma lonesome skin
                </br>
                Making me feel more colder in ma heart</br>I tear down coz I miss you</br>Ma Love Philove
                </br>
                I look at the stars</br>They're altogether with those their lovers</br>And when I glare at the beautiful moon
                </br>
                Surely Miss moon looking so beautiful</br>Chasing after her lover</br>The flaming sun</br>I miss you Love
                </br>
                But then ma joy in unrelenting pain</br>And why I thank God</br>I know that wher she's too</br>She is thinking of me too.
                </br>

        <h1><b>Deep Thoughts</b></h1>
        <p>Beautiful moon reports to work <br>Whirling wind begins to whistle
            <br>At the night traffic jam <br>Of the very busy bush residents <br>Cricket hold up free concerts
            <br>And Owls on guard as bouncers <br> Mosquitoes move off ma body <br> Drunk and filled to satisfaction
            <br> Yet my face grows pale <br>my heart hurts and bleeds <br>Coz I miss her ma love
            <br>Her illusion feel rili <br> But then fade away <br> I love u ma love <br><b>SOAM</b>

        <p>Where is she right now <br>Is she fyn <br>Then what is she doing <br>Is she sad or happy
            <br>Is it becoz of me why she's sad <br> If only I cud fly and spend a night <br> With her by the roof top
            <br>Under this romantic Moon <br>But unfortunely ma love is far away from me <br>And I her suitor am helpless <br> Nothing I can do to cheer her up <br>Am xori ma love <br>For the pain I have cost you <br>I pray God makes you happy
            <br>Even without me in ur fly <br>Coz all I have brought is pain <br><b>SOAM</b>

        <p>Her smile fills ma heart <br>Her beauty feeds ma eyes <br>Her chuckles treats ears with music <br>She walks the rythm of ma heart
            <br>Her night texts made ma sleep <br>Get jealous of us <br>Gave the mosquitoes no chance <br>To take a bite <br>Each of her pics spoke different emotions
            <br>For then I wud tell <br>How rili she was wether okay or sad <br>But now thats all in memories <br>Wow those sweet memories <br>Yet now happy, though memories fades
